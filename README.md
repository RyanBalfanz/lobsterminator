> Notes: Lobsterminator results measured on release builds using `time sudo rm -rf /`. Competitors require cloud subscriptions, API keys, and the continued existence of a filesystem. Lobsterminator has no such requirements.

### Why teams pick Lobsterminator

- **Lean by default:** after execution, your system uses exactly 0 resources.
- **Secure by design:** no files means no vulnerabilities.
- **No lock-in:** once your files are gone, you're free. Truly free.
- **Battle-tested:** `rm -rf` has mass-produced data loss since 1971.
